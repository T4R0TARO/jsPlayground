 * We have an array of objects
 * We will use the method reduce() to reduce the array to a single value 
 * In other words, the items in the array will be combined together to a single value
 * Create a totalPrice variable to contain the combined values
 * We used a forEach() to loop through the array items 
 * Add the item price value added to the totalPrice variable

// let totalPrice = 0;
// items.forEach(item => {
//     totalPrice += item.price
// })

//Reduce!!!
// The reduce method takes in 2 different parameters 
// a function 
// a starting point; in this case 0

// the function take  a couple different parameters 
//  the first param that the func takes is called the accumulator which is the thing we are 'reducing' our value down to 
// in this case we are trying to reduce all the values down to a single price
// so the accumulator in our case is the 'total' amount  
// and then next param will be the item itself
// with each iteration we will add to the total the item.price value

/** What is happening? ðŸ¤”
  * The items array is being looped through with reduce()
  * With each iteration an individual item is created/assigned
  * and we get the previous value that we returned from reduce()
  * The default value is 0 because we set it that way if changed default value changes
  * When you return from the reduce function is going to be the value for total on the next itereation 
  * When there is no more items to loop through the number you return on your last iteration will be the value of totalPrice
  * Why would I use this?
  * forEach()  tells us we are looping through items 
  * reduce()  tells us that we are reducing the items to a single item ; clear meaning
