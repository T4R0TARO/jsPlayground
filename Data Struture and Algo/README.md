* What are the inputs that go into the problem?
* What are the outputs that should come from the solution
to the problem
* Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other
words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
* How should I label the important pieces of data that are
a part of the problem?

//======================================================
//  Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum
//======================================================
// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
"implement addition"
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    // - ints?
    // - floats?
    // - what about string for large numbers?
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    // - int? float? string?
// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
 
// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?
